# Puppeteer
Creature Pose Viewer (and maybe eventually more) for Creatures Docking Station. Occasionally works sometimes. 
Download it from the [releases page](https://github.com/Amaikokonut/Puppeteer/releases).

This was my first Java project, please be nice to me ;;

Depends on:
* https://github.com/PuppyPi/jagent-core

Which in turn depends on:
* https://github.com/PuppyPi/rebound-core
* https://github.com/PuppyPi/dependency-annotations
* https://github.com/PuppyPi/javax-annotation

**However**, no one can get these to actually work, so this project is on hiatus unless someone can write around them (see [issue #19](https://github.com/Amaikokonut/Puppeteer/issues/19)).
